            <p>
                I stumbled upon Guild Wars 2 while up late with a newborn baby who was struggling to sleep.
                I downloaded the game and just to keep myself awake, and to be busy doing something.
                I just jumped on the 10-hour free trial raptor, and just rode around the map.
                I quickly found that there were areas of the map I could not go without immediately dying.
                I consistently noticed that events kept popping up for me to participate in, no matter where I went on the map, and some of them were very tempting to stop riding and see what was going on.
                Sometimes I would go by HUGE groups of monsters, and large groups of players fighting them, but a lot of times it was just me and my raptor trying to survive.
                By the end of the free 10 hour trial, I had so many places that I wanted to go back to, so many places I wanted to learn more about.
                So many adventures I couldn't wait to have.
                Well I spent quite a bit of time traveling around to those places I had seen, and something in particular hooked me.
                I loved walking back through a land, and being notified of something that needed my assistance.
                I would walk up and start helping out with the task.
                Well after spending a significant amount of time doing this I was kind of burned out of the tasks in a particular area. 
                I decided to follow a group of players who were following an NPC with green box above his head.
                I thought it was funny to follow the group of players and cast healing spells on them as they walked, but I couldn't figure out what they were doing.
                Then suddenly out of nowhere, the NPC attacked!
                I was completely taken off guard. It was super strong, and actually killed me at some point in the fight.
                Luckily was able to get back to the fight quickly, and help finish him off. 
                After the battle, the NPC disappeared. I chatted to the group of players to see if they would let me know what happened.
                And that is when I learned about guilds (groups of players who play together), and where I was introduced to the absolute MASSIVE world that is Guild Wars 2.
                Up to that point. I had only played only 1 little part of the game. There was so. much. more!
                There were other maps, other game modes, and even other skills my character could do.
                And the most valuable part to me was the amazing group of people that I had found who wanted to play it all with me.
                They wanted to share the victories and failures together with me.
                I was led by the hand by many patient veterans into training grounds to help me learn how to play better.
                And I was introduced into all of the different game modes that Guild Wars 2 had to offer.
