            <p>
                I stumbled upon Guild Wars 2 while up late with a newborn baby who was struggling to sleep.
                I downloaded the game and just to keep myself awake, and to be busy doing something.
                I just jumped on the 10-hour free trial raptor, and just rode around the map.

                I quickly found that there were areas of the map I could not go without immediately dying.

                I consistently noticed that events popped up no matter where I went on the map.

                There were things that were calling for me to come help constantly (and some were very hard to ignore).
                
                Sometimes there were HUGE monsters, and large groups of players, but a lot of times it was just me and my raptor trying to survive.

                By the end of the free 10 hour trial, I had so many places that I wanted to go back to, so many places I wanted to learn more about.

                So many adventures I couldn't wait to have.

                Well I spent quite a bit of time traveling around to those places I had seen, and something in particular hooked me.

                I loved walking back through a land, and being notified of something that needed my assistance.

                I would walk up and start helping out with the task.

                Well after spending a significant amount of time doing this and meeting other players briefly, 
                one day I decided to follow a group of players who were following an NPC.

                I thought it was funny to cast healing spells on them as they walked, but I couldn't figure out what they were doing.

                Then suddenly out of nowhere, the NPC attacked!

                I died, but luckily was able to get back to the fight quickly.

                After the battle. I chatted to the group to find out what that was all about.

                That is where I was introduced to the massive world I had stepped into, and the MANY MANY MANY other things I had never even known were in the game.

                There were other maps, other game modes, other skills and masteries my character could do.

                And most importantly, there were other people in the game who wanted to play all of those game modes with me, and wanted to share the victories and failures together with me.

                I was led by the hand by many patient veterans into training grounds, and into all of the different game modes.
