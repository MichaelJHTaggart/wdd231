   <h1>Website Plan</h1>

   <section>
      <h2>Site Name: Play Guild Wars 2</h2>
      <p>Optional Domain availability: playguildwars2.com</p>

      <h2>Scenarios:</h2>
      <p>
         This is going to be a static html + css + javascript website. With zero libraries, frameworks, or modules.

         The purpose of this website is to excite, entice, pump-up, gain interest in trying out the video game Guild Wars 2.

         We want to target people who have never or seldomly have played video games, and also hype up people who already do.

         The first page of the website should do this by:

         - making a visually stunning/interesting website: the website should WOW someone with how cool it looks.
         - next it should provide some kind of interactive interesting information either directly linked to the actual game (using the Guild Wars 2 API or wiki)
         - giving light education on the game with CTAs to learn more.

         One page should have extensive information about what can be done in the game, and one of the CTAs should link to fill out a form to join the guild.

         The information page should be educating the user about the game by answering questions like:
         What is the game?
         What do you do in the game?

         Why play?
         - There are many reasons.
         - Your hero is always needed here.
         - No matter where you go, you will find that there is something unique happening that you can directly affect.
         - There are some things happening where you need to call on others to help you succeed.

         From the API, I want to pull the active world events to display to the users. I think that would be a cool example showing there are things happening right now!

         I want the interactive map, but I also want users to jump in without seeing the map.
         I want them to kind of figure it out.

         I have some video of the gameplay.
